# Hubble-Law
This was my submission for the Krittika Summer Projects 2021-Freshies where I calculate Hubble's constant and the age of the universe. 
Here, I analysed data such as angular diameters and redshifts from online datasets provided to infer their respective velocities and distances to calculate the Hubbleâ€™s Constant and the approximate age of the universe.
